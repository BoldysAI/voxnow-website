## Component Architecture Patterns

### State Management
- **Local State**: React hooks (useState, useEffect) for component-specific state
- **Global State**: Context API for shared application state
- **External State**: Firebase real-time listeners for live data updates

### Data Flow
- **Props Down**: Parent components pass data to children via props
- **Events Up**: Child components communicate with parents via callback functions
- **Side Effects**: useEffect hooks for API calls and external integrations

### Error Handling
- **Try-Catch Blocks**: Async operations wrapped in error handling
- **User Feedback**: Loading states and error messages for user experience
- **Fallback UI**: Graceful degradation when components fail

### Performance Optimization
- **Lazy Loading**: Components loaded on-demand using React.lazy
- **Memoization**: React.memo for preventing unnecessary re-renders
- **Debouncing**: Input debouncing for search and filter operations

## Integration Points

### External Services
- **Firebase**: Authentication, database, and storage
- **Airtable**: Structured data management
- **OpenAI**: AI-powered chat responses
- **EmailJS**: Email notifications
- **Calendly**: Appointment scheduling
- **Facebook Pixel**: Analytics tracking

### API Communication
- **REST APIs**: Standard HTTP requests for external services
- **Real-time Updates**: Firebase listeners for live data
- **Webhook Integration**: Processing pipeline for voicemail analysis
- **Error Handling**: Retry logic and fallback mechanisms

## Testing Considerations

### Component Testing
- **Unit Tests**: Individual component functionality

- **Accessibility Tests**: WCAG compliance verification

### Performance Testing
- **Load Testing**: Component performance under stress
