## Core Components

### 1. Frontend Application (React + TypeScript)
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript for type safety
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized builds
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for responsive design
- **State Management**: React hooks and context
- **Routing**: React Router DOM for SPA navigation

### 2. Backend Services (Firebase)
- **Authentication**: Firebase Auth for user management
- **Database**: Firestore for real-time data storage
- **File Storage**: Firebase Storage for audio files
- **Security**: Custom security rules for data protection

### 3. External Integrations
- **AI Processing**: OpenAI API for transcription and analysis
- **Data Storage**: Airtable for structured voicemail data
- **Communication**: EmailJS for email notifications
- **Scheduling**: Calendly for appointment booking
- **Analytics**: Facebook Pixel for conversion tracking

## Data Flow Architecture

### Voicemail Processing Pipeline

```
Audio Recording → Firebase Storage → AI Processing → Airtable Storage → Client Notification
      ↓                ↓                 ↓              ↓                    ↓
   Web Interface → Secure Upload → OpenAI API → Structured Data → SMS/Email
```

### User Interaction Flow

```
User Login → Dashboard → Message Management → Analytics → Client Communication
    ↓            ↓            ↓                ↓              ↓
Firebase Auth → Firestore → Airtable API → Statistics → Automated SMS
```
