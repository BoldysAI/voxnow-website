- **Communication**: EmailJS for email notifications
- **Scheduling**: Calendly for appointment booking
- **Analytics**: Facebook Pixel for conversion tracking

## Data Flow Architecture

### Voicemail Processing Pipeline

```
Audio Recording → Supabase Storage → AI Processing → PostgreSQL → Client Notification
      ↓                ↓                 ↓              ↓                    ↓
   Web Interface → Secure Upload → Supabase Edge Functions → Structured Data → Analytics
```

### User Interaction Flow

```
User Login → Dashboard → Message Management → Analytics → Profile Management
    ↓            ↓            ↓                ↓              ↓
Supabase Auth → PostgreSQL → Real-time Updates → Statistics → User Settings
```
